# MEMORY GARDEN

UPDATES:

23 OCTOBER
- NPCs now navigate the navmesh (main plane) by their own volition. They can pick a random direction and head towards it, and decide to stop and idle before changing directions. Basically, they wander.
- Animation states are set, all NPCs will share the same states as Tommy, who is the only one nearly fully-implemented
- Picking up "desired objects" and dropping them works with physics and all
- Art style is set, some placeholder assets need tweaking but the spawn area is complete

6 NOVEMBER
- Finished implementing NPC mechanics fully. Each NPC can now have their own desired item, will have their own cameras for cutscenes and their own dialogue that gets randomly cycled.
- Moving away from beta environment to implementing the first level. Goal for the 27th is to have one fully implemented level with NPCs, a decorated environment and the ability to unlock the second level.
- Game idea solidifed: Each level is themed to a piece of old media, with the NPCs and environment made to be reminiscent of that piece of media with disturbances, glitches and slightly off things. The next level is unlocked when each NPC receives their desired item and "ascends" out of the level. Other levels will always be in sight, just blocked by doors or obstacles, a la Banjo Tooie.

To do:
- Fully populate first level with props and 2 more NPCs
- Complete level unlocking mechanic after all NPCs have received their items, revealing the next level/world
- Have the HUB room/world (reception area) change depending on how far the player has progressed
