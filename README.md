# MEMORY GARDEN

UPDATES:

23 OCTOBER
- NPCs now navigate the navmesh (main plane) by their own volition. They can pick a random direction and head towards it, and decide to stop and idle before changing directions. Basically, they wander.
- Animation states are set, all NPCs will share the same states as Tommy, who is the only one nearly fully-implemented
- Picking up "desired objects" and dropping them works with physics and all
- Art style is set, some placeholder assets need tweaking but the spawn area is complete

To do:
- Fix visual issues (skybox splicing, some objects not effected by deferred fog)
- Implement NPC dialogue, ambient sounds, and them accepting desired items/reacting to them
- Implement calculating what NPCs have done/wandered to during the time that the player has not been playing (Animal Crossing-esque)
